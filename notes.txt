==========================================

FORKING:

1. Create fork clicking button (on github.com/project-you-want-to-fork)
2. in your terminal, navigate to where you want the folder to be created
   
   git clone <url-from-the-fork-not-from-the-original> 

(connection to local machine from fork is then called "origin")

3. cd into that folder (you could also restart vscode just with that folder just in case)
4. open it up into vscode (" code . " )
5. *make edits*
then UPDATING LIFECYCLE to get to commit, regular terminal COMMANDS (use origin)

    1. git add . (. means all, could just upload one file, would put <filename>)
    2. git commit -m "my message goes here" (first message is usually "first commit")
    3. git push <remote_name> <branch> (git push origin master/main) * we want to use origin / main
